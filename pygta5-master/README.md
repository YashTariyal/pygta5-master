# Python Plays Grand Theft Auto 5 - Reboot

<p align="center"><img src="_media/charles.webp"></p>

This is a reboot of the project from 2017, but with a whole new approach. This time, instead of collecting data by hand and training a classification model, we opted to create a whole new system for the data collecting, training and playing, and to do all of that live. Our models are now using regression (with other output types being still possible), training data is collected automatically and we stream models during their training phase so anyone can join and watch the progress.

Our AI, besides having multiple alter-egos (models), is still called **Charles**, like in 2017.

For a full explanation, refer to the [`System`](project_info/system.md) page, but for a quick summary - we’re using a central server that all other parts connect to. The [`Data Collectors`](project_info/system.md) run in separate GTA5 instances and our NPCs are collecting and [`Balancing`](project_info/data_balancing.md) the data, which is sent through the [`Server`](project_info/system.md) to the [`Trainer`](project_info/system.md). The [`Trainer`](project_info/system.md) buffers these data, trains the model and updates the [`Player`](project_info/system.md). The [`Player`](project_info/system.md) is using the [`Dual-Camera`](project_info/cameras.md) system to play so we can watch the 3rd person camera (also called cinematic camera) while the model is fed the [`Hood Camera`](project_info/cameras.md).

# Stream and current stream layout:
The progress is being streamed on Twitch: [https://www.twitch.tv/sentdex](https://www.twitch.tv/sentdex). Below we keep a list of dates and streamed models.

Stream's layout consists of:
![layout.jpg](_media/layout.jpg)  
- top-left tile is the 3rd person camera of the car driving, the main camera to observe Charles
- this main tile, in its lower-right corner, shows the current model and when it's been created
- top-right tile called [`Hood Camera`](project_info/cameras.md) is exactly what the models "see" - the input to the convolutional backbone of the model
- middle-right tile called [`Convcam`](project_info/convcam.md) shows the reshaped output of the CNN backbone and lets us observe how the CNN part trains
- bottom-right tile called [`Player Console`](project_info/system.md) shows current driving predictions along with additional information
- bottom-middle tile called [`Server/Trainer Console`](project_info/system.md) shows training progress along with some basic training information
- bottom-left tile called [`Tensorboard`](tensorboard_logs) shows the loss of the training process
