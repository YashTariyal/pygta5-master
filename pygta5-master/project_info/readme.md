# Main project description

For more information about the system refer the pages:
- [`System`](../project_info/system.md) - describing how all parts are working together to train and inference the models
- [`Cameras`](../project_info/cameras.md) - how we created multiple cameras
- [`Convcam`](../project_info/convcam.md) - what the Convcam is and how we use it
- [`Data Balancing`](../project_info/data_balancing.md) - how are we balancing regression data
- [`NPCs`](../project_info/NPCs.md) - our custom NPCs playing in the GTA5 to collect data automatically
- [`Purpose`](../project_info/purpose.md) - a way to let the model “know” where to drive
- [`Storage and Buffer`](../project_info/storage_buffer.md) - how are we managing the training data and why random batches are important
- [`Unstuck`](../project_info/unstuck.md) - how to make the car not be stuck anywhere

For more information about the model architectures used refer the pages:
- [`Xception`](../project_info/xception.md) - the first CNN backbone architecture used
- [`InceptionResNetv2`](../project_info/inceptionresnetv2.md) - the second, more successful CNN backbone architecture used
